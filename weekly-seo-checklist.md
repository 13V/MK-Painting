# Weekly SEO Checklist: Maintain Your Rankings

SEO isn't a "one-and-done" task. To keep those #1 spots in Gawler, Mawson Lakes, and Golden Grove, follow this 15-minute weekly routine.

## 🗓️ Every Monday: The "Freshness" Signal
- [ ] **Google Business Post**: Upload 1 photo of a project from the previous week. Use one of the pre-written templates in `gbp-optimization-assets.md`.
- [ ] **Check Service Areas**: Quickly open your GBP dashboard to ensure Gawler and other targets are still listed.

## ✉️ Every Wednesday: The "Trust" Signal
- [ ] **Review Requests**: Send the "Review SMS" (from `review-strategy.md`) to every customer you finished a job for this week.
- [ ] **Respond to Reviews**: If you got a new 5-star review, respond to it! (Example: "Thanks [Name]! Great working on your Mawson Lakes home.")

## 🔗 Every Friday: The "Authority" Signal
- [ ] **Manual Search Check**: Open an Incognito window and search "Painter [Suburb]". See if M&K is moving up or down.
- [ ] **Backlink Outreach**: Send **just one** email or LinkedIn message to a local Real Estate Agent or Community group using the templates in `backlink-strategy.md`.

## 🛑 What NOT to do:
- **Don't buy fake reviews**: Google will suspend your profile instantly.
- **Don't overcomplicate it**: Stick to the Google tools for now. You don't need paid software like Ahrefs yet.
- **Don't stop posting**: Google loves active businesses. Even a photo of a fresh tin of paint at a job site counts as "activity."

## 📈 Long-Term Growth (Monthly)
- **Content**: Build 1 new blog post a month about a specific paint color trend or a common Adelaide painting problem (e.g. "Efflorescence on Adelaide Brickwork").
- **Audit**: Use the `seo-tracking-guide.md` to check your actual traffic in Google Search Console.
