                <p style="font-size: 1.15rem; color: #ccc; margin-top: 12px;">Adelaide's trusted family-owned painters
                    since 2005</p>

            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>M&K Painting Services is a proudly family-owned and operated business serving the greater Adelaide region
                for over 20 years. What began as a small operation has grown into one of the most trusted names in
                residential, commercial, and heritage painting across South Australia.</p>

            <p>We believe a great finish starts long before the first coat of paint goes on. Our process centres on
                thorough preparation, honest communication, and using only premium materials from trusted brands like
                Dulux, Haymes, and Taubmans. Every project we take on — whether it's a cosy Mawson Lakes apartment or a
                sprawling Gawler homestead — receives the same attention to detail and care.</p>

            <h2>Our Qualifications &amp; Credentials</h2>
            <p>We take professionalism seriously. M&K Painting Services holds all the licences, certifications, and
                insurance required to deliver safe, compliant work across South Australia:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 16px 0 24px 24px; line-height: 2;">
                <li><strong>Builder's Licence:</strong> BLD251492</li>
                <li><strong>ABN:</strong> 25 623 085 946</li>
                <li><strong>Master Painters Association</strong> member</li>
                <li><strong>Public Liability Insurance:</strong> $20 million coverage</li>
                <li><strong>White Card</strong> certified (construction site safety)</li>
                <li><strong>Scissor Lift &amp; Boom Lift</strong> certified for high-access work</li>
                <li><strong>3-Year Workmanship Guarantee</strong> on every project</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Sets Us Apart</h2>
            <p>Unlike large franchise operations, we're hands-on from the initial estimate right through to the final
                inspection. You'll deal directly with the people doing the work — no middlemen, no subcontractors, no
                surprises. We show up when we say we will, we finish on time, and we clean up after ourselves.</p>

            <p>Our pricing is transparent and competitive. We provide detailed written estimates that break down every
                element of the job, so you know exactly what you're paying for. There are no hidden extras or vague "it
                might cost more" conversations partway through a project.</p>

            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>We offer a complete range of professional finishes for homes and businesses across Adelaide:</p>
            <ul style="margin: 16px 0 24px 24px; line-height: 2;">

                <li><strong>Commercial projects</strong> — offices, retail spaces, strata buildings</li>
