## 💡 3 Tips for Better Reviews
1. **Mention the Suburb:** Ask customers if they can mention their suburb (e.g., "M&K did a great job on our **Gawler** home"). Google reads these and boosts you for that specific area!
2. **Photos are Gold:** If a customer uploads a photo of the finished job with their review, Google gives it 5x more ranking "weight."
3. **Reply to Every Review:** When you reply, Google sees an active business.
   - *Example Reply:* "Thanks for the kind words, Sarah! It was a pleasure painting your heritage home in Gawler."
