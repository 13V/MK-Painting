# Facebook Ad Strategy: Get Kitchen Respray Leads ASAP

For "ASAP" jobs, Facebook and Instagram are superior to Google because they are visual. A "Before & After" photo of a kitchen is a lead-generation magnet.

## 🎯 The Offer: "The $25,000 Kitchen Look for 1/5th the Price"
Don't just sell "painting." Sell a **Kitchen Transformation**.

## 🚀 Next Step:
