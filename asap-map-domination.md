# ASAP Map Domination Roadmap (Gawler & Golden Grove) 🗺️⚡

To rank in the Map Pack for suburbs that aren't your primary address, we need to create "Geographic Density." This guide focuses on forcing Google to recognize your relevance *right now*.

## 1. The "Product Catalog" Hack (High Impact)
Google prioritizes listings with a populated **Product Catalog** because it makes the profile more interactive. 
**Action:** Add these as "Products" in your GBP (use a photo for each):

*   **Product:** "Heritage Restoration Gawler"
    *   **Description:** "Premium painting for historic Gawler cottages. Specialized in stone conservation and Edwardian color schemes."
*   **Product:** "Interior Refresh Golden Grove"
    *   **Description:** "Durable, family-friendly interior painting for modern Golden Grove residences. Wash-and-wear finishes included."
*   **Product:** "Roof & Exterior Cooling (Foothills)"
    *   **Description:** "Heat-reflective exterior coatings perfect for Golden Grove and foothills homes to reduce summer cooling costs."

## 2. Triggering "Their Website Mentions" Snippets
Google often shows a snippet in maps saying *"Their website mentions [keyword]"*. We need to force this for Gawler and Golden Grove.

**Action:** I have already updated your pages, but we will add one more "Local Service Log" (Case Studies) to the bottom of the suburb pages to include terms like "Interior Painting near Murray St" or "Weatherproof coating Golden Grove foothills."

## 3. The "Entity Anchor" Posts (Weekly Routine)
Use these exact captions for your GBP posts over the next 3 weeks:

*   **Week 1 (Gawler):** "Working near **Pioneer Park** today! Restoring the classic charm of a Gawler bungalow. We love preserving the local history in **Gawler East**. #GawlerPainter #HeritageRestoration"
*   **Week 2 (Golden Grove):** "Early morning start in **Golden Grove**. Applying protective coatings to a beautiful family home near **Fairview Park**. Ensuring this foothills property is ready for the winter rains! #GoldenGrovePainting #LocalPainter"

## 4. Local Authority Links (User Task)
Since I can't sign up for you, please ensure M&K is listed in these specific local pockets:
*   [ ] **Gawler Business Hub Directory**
*   [ ] **Golden Grove Community Noticeboard** (Facebook Group)
*   [ ] **I Love Gawler** (Facebook Group)
*   *Note: When you join these, occasionally share a "Tip of the week" (e.g. 'How to check your exterior paint for sun damage') instead of just a sales pitch.*

## 5. Tracking Your Progress
Don't just look at the map once. Map rankings change depending on where you are standing.
*   **Tool Tip:** Use a tool like **Local Falcon** or **BrightLocal** (they have free trials) to see a "Map Grid" of your rankings. This will show you exactly which streets in Gawler you are winning vs. losing.
