# Commercial Growth Strategy: Landing High-Value Adelaide Contracts

While residential jobs pay the bills, **Commercial Projects** (Offices, Retail, Strata) are the key to scaling M&K Painting's revenue. LinkedIn is the best place to find the "Gatekeepers."

## 🎯 Target Audience
**Who makes the decisions?**
1. **Facility Managers:** For office buildings and shopping centers.
2. **Strata Managers:** For apartment complexes and townhomes.
3. **Property Managers (Commercial):** For retail strips.
4. **Architects/Builders:** For new developments or renovations.

## 🏗️ 1. LinkedIn Profile Optimization
*Your LinkedIn profile shouldn't be a resume; it should be a landing page.*

*   **Headline:** "Premium Commercial & Strata Painting Adelaide | M&K Painting Services | 20+ Yrs Experience"
*   **Banner:** A high-quality photo of the M&K van or a large exterior project (e.g., a commercial shopfront).
*   **Featured Section:** Link to your **[SEO Proposal/Portfolio](https://www.mandkpaintingservices.com.au/seo-proposal.html)** so they can see your professionalism immediately.

## ✉️ 2. The "Soft" Outreach Script
*Do not sell immediately. Offer value.*

"Hi [Name], 

I’m [Your Name] from M&K Painting Services here in Adelaide. I noticed you manage several properties in the [Northern Suburbs/Gawler] area.

We specialize in commercial refreshes and strata maintenance, focusing on minimal disruption to tenants (after-hours work, low-VOC paints).

If you ever need a quick, professional quote for a common area or a shopfront refresh, I’d love to be on your 'Preferred Vendor' list. No pressure, just wanted to introduce ourselves as a local option.

Best,
[Your Name]"

## 💰 3. The "Portfolio of Proof"
When talking to commercial clients, they care about:
1. **Insurance:** Mention your $20M Public Liability.
2. **Safety:** Mention your white cards and OHS compliance.
3. **Speed:** Mention your ability to scale the team for large deadlines.

## 🚀 Action Plan:
1. **Identify 20 local Property Managers** on LinkedIn this week.
2. **Send 5 Connection requests** per day with a personalized note.
3. **Follow up** with the intro script above only after they connect.

## 💡 Next Move: Facebook Ads for Kitchens?
Would you like me to draft a high-conversion **Facebook Ad** for **Kitchen Cabinet Respraying**? It's one of the highest-margin jobs for painters right now and works incredibly well with visual ads.
