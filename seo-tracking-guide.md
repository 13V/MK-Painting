# SEO Tracking Guide: Monitoring Progress for Free

You don't need Ahrefs to win at local SEO. Google provides the most accurate data directly through their own free toolset. Here is exactly how to check your progress.

## 🛠️ 1. Google Search Console (GSC) — The "Must-Have"
Search Console is the most important tool for SEO. It tells you exactly which keywords people use to find you and what position you are in.

*   **Setup:** Go to [search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console/) and verify your domain (`mandkpaintingservices.com.au`).
*   **What to Check:**
    *   **Performance Tab:** Filter by "Queries" to see if you are appearing for "Painter Gawler" or "Mawson Lakes Painting."
    *   **Pages Tab:** Check if your new suburb pages (e.g., `gawler.html`) have been indexed (found by Google).
    *   **Sitemap:** Submit your `sitemap.xml` here to force Google to find the new pages faster.

## 📍 2. Google Business Profile (Performance Tab)
Since we want to dominate the "Map Pack," this is where you'll see your real-world local impact.

*   **How to Access:** Search "My Business" on Google while logged into your account.
*   **What to Check:** Click on **"Performance"**.
    *   **Interactions:** How many people called you directly from the map?
    *   **How people found you:** See a breakdown of "Direct" vs. "Discovery" (Discovery means they searched for "painter" and found you).

## 📊 3. Google Analytics 4 (GA4) — Traffic Source
This tool tells you what people do *after* they land on your site.

*   **Setup:** Go to [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com).
*   **What to Check:**
    *   **Reports > Acquisition > Traffic Acquisition:** Look for "Organic Search." If this number is going up, our content strategy is working.
    *   **Conversions:** Track how many people filled out the contact form on your new suburb pages.

---

## 🕵️ 4. Manual "Incognito" Check — The Reality Check
Third-party tools can be 1-2 weeks behind. The fastest way to check a specific keyword is a manual search.

*   **Action:** Open a **New Incognito Window** (so your personal history doesn't bias the results).
*   **Search**: "Painter Gawler" or "Premium Painters Mawson Lakes."
*   **Tip:** If you see "M&K Painting Services" appearing in the search results, it means Google has officially indexed the page.

## ⚡ 5. Vercel Web Analytics — The "Speedometer"
If you are hosting on Vercel, this is the easiest way to see your traffic without dealing with complex Google reports.

*   **Setup:** Enable "Web Analytics" in your Vercel Project Dashboard.
*   **What to Check:**
    *   **Visitors & Views:** A clean, accurate count of real humans visiting your site.
    *   **Web Vitals:** Tells you exactly how "fast" your site feels to customers.
    *   **Top Pages:** See which suburb page is getting the most attention this week.

## 🔥 6. PageSpeed Insights
Google prioritizes fast websites. Use this to ensure our "Performance Polish" is holding up as you add more project photos.

*   **Link:** [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
*   **Score Goal:** We aim for **90+** in the "SEO" and "Best Practices" categories.

## 📈 When should you expect results?
*   **1–7 Days**: Google finds the new pages. You might see them appear on page 5 or 6.
*   **2–4 Weeks**: Rankings stabilize. You should start seeing the pages climb towards Page 1 as you get more **Reviews** and **Citations**.
*   **3 Months**: Peak performance. This is usually when you reach the top 1-3 spots if the reviews keep coming in.
