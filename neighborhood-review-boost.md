Google's Map algorithm heavily weighs the **geographic keywords** found in your review replies. By mentioning specific suburbs and services, you "anchor" your business to that location in Google's database.

## 🛠️ The Strategy: "Anchor Replies"

When you get a new review, follow these templates. **Do not just say "Thanks!"**

### 📍 Target: Gawler (Heritage/Interior)
*   **User Review:** "Amazing job on our old cottage!"
*   **Your Reply:** "Thank you! It was an absolute pleasure working on your **heritage home in Gawler**. We take great pride in preserving the local character near **Murray St**. Glad you love the new interior finish!"

### 📍 Target: Golden Grove (Family/Exterior)

## 📸 The "Maps" Photo Trick (Recap)

1.  **Open the Google Maps app** on your phone while standing at the job site.
2.  **Search for M&K Painting Services.**
3.  **Upload a photo** of the finished job immediately.

## 🗓️ Weekly Routine
*   **Check GSC:** See if the Gawler page is getting "Impressions" (I showed you how in the Tracking Guide).
*   **Update GBP:** Post one "Suburb specific" post per week using the updated templates in your assets file.
