## 💡 Important Tips for 2026
1. **Always Upload Photos:** When a directory asks for photos, upload 5-10 project shots (use the ones from your gallery). Google prioritizes listings with images.
2. **Category Choice:** If "Painter" isn't available, use "Construction" or "Home Improvement" as the secondary category.
3. **Internal Links:** On directories that allow it, link directly to your suburb pages (e.g., link to your Gawler page from the Gawler-specific listing).
