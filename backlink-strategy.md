# Backlink Strategy: Building Adelaide Authority

A "backlink" is a link from another website to yours. For local SEO, 1 link from a local Adelaide site is worth more than 100 links from random global sites.

## 🎯 Top Local Targets
**Aim for these local "Neighborhood" links to prove to Google you are the local expert.**

### 1. Real Estate Agents (Gawler & Mawson Lakes)
Local agents often have a "Recommended Tradies" page.
- **Why:** High relevance. People moving house need painters.
- **Action:** Contact 3 agents in Gawler (e.g., Ray White Gawler) and offer to be their "Preferred Painter" for rental refreshes. Ask for a link on their site in exchange.

### 2. Community Sport Clubs
- **Why:** Highly local (.com.au/suburb) domains.
- **Action:** Sponsor a local team (e.g., Mawson Lakes Cricket Club) for $250. This usually gets you a logo and a link on their "Sponsors" page.

### 3. Local Community Boards
- **Why:** Direct suburb relevance.
- **Action:** Submit an advice post (not an ad) to local community sites or Facebook groups that have a directory (e.g., "Gawler Community Board").

## 🔗 The "Supplier Link" (The Easy Win)
Do you buy your paint from a specific local shop (e.g., a local Bristol or Crowies)?
- **Action:** Check if they have a "Find a Painter" or "Our Customers" section on their website. Ask them to feature M&K with a link to your site.
